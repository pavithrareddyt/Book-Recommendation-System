A Book Recommendation System suggests books to users based on their interests, reading history, or preferences of similar users. It uses techniques like content-based filtering that matches book metadata like genres or authors and collaborative filtering that uses user behavior patterns. Advanced systems combine both approaches for better accuracy and relevance. These systems are widely used on platforms such as Goodreads, Amazon, and e-libraries to improve user experience.
